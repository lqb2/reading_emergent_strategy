                    <p>Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r3RFIiJwJRT8gLFOJh1cHotgxK-WL-0GV2JCuDvBXOw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_new">a spreadsheet</a> where you can share your own thoughts about what you're reading each week. Feel free to add your name to the spreadsheet and drop in your thoughts as they come to you.</p>
                <h3>In person</h3>
                <p>Each week, at least one group of us will be meeting together in person. We'll meet on alterating Wednesdays and Thursdays: Oct 4, Oct 12, Oct 18, Oct 26, Nov 1, Nov 9, Nov 15.</p>
                <p>If multiple groups form, we will all plan to join the same video call to see each other for just a few minutes each time we all gather.</p>
